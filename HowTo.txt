I've adapted the original procedure for the "1220" (Android 2.3) firmware version, from:

  http://www.slatedroid.com/topic/19640-objective-01-boot-os-from-sdcard-completed/page__view__findpost__p__201698

Find attached the new file:

Attached File  bootsd_1220.tar.gz (79.13K)
Number of downloads: 0

Procedure as follows:

- On your Linux host PC (tested on my Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit)

1) Extract from the original "1220" update package into some temporary dir these files

android-fs4.tar.gz
uImage4


2) Expand the attached file into the same temp dir. A new bootsd/ subdir is created.
3) Insert a 2Gb SD card on your PC (through a USB card reader, or whatever).
NOTE 1 - The card content is going to be erased completely.
NOTE 2 - The script should be modified for cards smaller than 2Gb.
4) Note what new device is created for the SD card. It's "/dev/sdd" in my case.
5) Create the bootable SD card with:

cd bootsd
chmod +x create_bootsd.sh
sudo ./create_bootsd.sh /dev/sdd


6) Wait for completion of all steps (takes around a 30 secs, or so)

- On your Rena tablet (tested on mine "second version"):

1) insert the bootable SD card into tablet
2) Boot with Vol+&Power (as if you were updating firmware)
3) Be patient! It took two-three minutes to get to the Android home screen first time.

To start the original NAND firmware, just shutdown and restart with the Power button as usual.

Known Issues

1) Overall device response is slower than that with internal NAND.
That's also a clue about what the final performance comes from...

2) Touchscreen and keys don't work... This is just a starting point!
Use a USB mouse to interact.
The original author of the procedure also patched the uboot4 and put into the internal NAND, but befpore moifying that I'd like to understand better what he has patched...
Hello tosan, are you still around?

Technical details

If you wish to discover how our bootloader works, have a look at the README-Renesas in https://github.com/f...sEV2-bootloader

The uboot-sd.bin has been hex-edited to patch the boot commands, so to start the root file system to the SD card partition:

bootcmd=run ext3cmd
ext3_root=/dev/mmcblk1p3
cfg_ddr=mem=129M@0x40000000 mem=256M@0x50000000
ext3cmd=setenv bootargs root=$(ext3_root) noinitrd init=/init console=ttyS0,115200n8n SELINUX_INIT=no $(cfg_ddr) rw video=qfb: ip=none rootfstype=ext3 rootwait;bootm 40007fc0



The init.rc has been modified to mount the SD card partitions, in place of the NAND ones
The vold.conf and vold.fstab content has been commented out as well, to remove the use of an external SD card (which is of course absent).
